# Git Setup Documentation

This document outlines the Git configuration and operations performed for the Brain-Dev project.

## Repository Initialization

The project was initialized as a Git repository in the `/home/coder/apps/brain-dev` directory. This allows for version control of all project files and changes.

## .gitignore Setup

A `.gitignore` file was created to exclude unnecessary files from version control, including:

- Node.js dependencies (`node_modules/`)
- Environment variable files (`.env*`)
- Log files
- Editor-specific files
- Build outputs
- Temporary files

This helps keep the repository clean and focused on essential source code files.

## Git Operations Performed

The following Git operations were executed:

1. **Repository Initialization**: 
   - Git repository was initialized in the project directory

2. **Adding Files**:
   - Project files were added to the staging area with `git add .`

3. **Committing Changes**:
   - Initial commit with message "brain-dev" was created
   - This included all project files and the `.gitignore` configuration

4. **Remote Repository Setup**:
   - Added a remote repository named "brain1" pointing to `https://github.com/flabwick/brain1.git`
   - Command used: `git remote add brain1 https://github.com/flabwick/brain1.git`

5. **Pushing to Remote**:
   - Pushed the local repository to the remote "brain1" repository
   - Set up tracking between local "master" branch and remote "brain1/master" branch
   - Command used: `git push --set-upstream brain1 master`

## Git Status

The repository is now set up with:
- Local "master" branch tracking remote "brain1/master"
- All project files committed and pushed to GitHub
- A proper `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files

## GitHub Access

The project is available on GitHub at:
- Repository URL: https://github.com/flabwick/brain1
- Pull Request URL: https://github.com/flabwick/brain1/pull/new/master

## Dependency Management

Node.js dependencies are managed through npm and are excluded from Git tracking. The `package.json` file contains all necessary dependency information for reinstallation with `npm install`.

## Next Steps

For future development:

1. Always pull the latest changes before starting work:
   ```
   git pull
   ```

2. Regularly commit your changes:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"
   ```

3. Push changes to the remote repository:
   ```
   git push
   ```

4. Consider creating feature branches for new development:
   ```
   git checkout -b feature/new-feature-name
   ```
